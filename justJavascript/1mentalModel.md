What Mental Models inform understanding ofour conception of the following (analogies and concepts)?
exampe of awareness of :
let a = 10;
let b = a;
a = 0;

a is 0 ; b is 10

I like this part: Maybe a tutorial we read early on has sacrificed correctness for the ease of explaining. Maybe we incorrectly transferred an intuition about a particular language feature, like this, from another language we learned earlier. Maybe we inferred a mental model from some piece of code and never really verified if it was accurate.

Interesting discussion about Thinking Fast & Slow, accompanied by bug in exampl e of spreadsheet copier.
